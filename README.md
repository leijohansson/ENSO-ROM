               functions defining the RK4 scheme
               values for variables that are kept constant
 ROMclass.py : class for running the model and plotting the time series and trajectory of the model
 runclass.py : functions for different tasks/runs the model under various settings
 stability.py: function to plot the spectral radius against time-step size for Heun, Euler and RK4 iterative schemes
